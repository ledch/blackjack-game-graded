# blackjack-game

A blackjack game that tells the user if they have won or lost or can continue playing. 

Based off of the Scrimba blackjack game with some modified code.

Modifications:
- can not continue clicking "START GAME" after losing (same as "NEW CARD")
- slight code differences

Some limitations: 
- it is possible to use "START GAME" with the same functionality as the "NEW CARD" button
   - having the button disable after the first click would be helpful
- Currently the player's name is "Per" and the amount of chips they have is set at $145. Obviously this is not your name and number of chips.
  - added functionality could include saving person's name and chips as an input and displaying it after
