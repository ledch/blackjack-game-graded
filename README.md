# blackjack-game

A blackjack game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Based off of the Scrimba blackjack game with added modifications and changed code:

Modifications:
- you can not press both START GAME and NEW CARD at the same time(once you start a game, you can not press it again until the game is over)
- START GAME will start a new game once you either lose or win

Some limitations: 
- pulling an "Ace" here does not allow you to choose either 1 or 11 as the value (sets it to 11 instead)
- Currently the player's name is "Per" and the amount of chips they have is set at $145. Obviously this is not your name and number of chips.
  - added functionality could include saving person's name and chips as an input and displaying it after
