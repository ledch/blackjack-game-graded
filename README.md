# blackjack-game

A blackjack game that tells the user if they have won or lost or can continue playing. 

Based off of the Scrimba blackjack game with some modified code.

Modifications:
- the game will reset after you lose
- you can only press either START GAME or NEW CARD at once (why start a new game while in the middle of one?)
- slight code differences

Some limitations: 
- pulling an "Ace" here does not allow you to choose either 1 or 11 as the value (sets it to 11 instead)
- Currently the player's name is "Per" and the amount of chips they have is set at $145. Obviously this is not your name and number of chips.
  - added functionality could include saving person's name and chips as an input and displaying it after
